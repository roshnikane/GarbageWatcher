# GarbageWatcher
This is the tool that will detect garbage and alert the authorities with location and timestamp

## Problem Statement
Garbage containers in cities often overflow because they are not monitored regularly, causing bad smell and health problems for people. There is a need for a system that can automatically alert authorities when a garbage tank is full and help them clean it on time to keep the city clean and healthy.
## What we are proposing
we build a system if Garbage container getting overflow then system detect it and give the alert message to the municipal via the Email or the SMS ,traking the location of that garbage container then municiple flow that and collect the garbage , mark the system as clean the container by the municiple   
## What work has been done by others and fault in it
Others did IoT based project by using the ultrasonic sensor and in anthor one they include the uploaded image system through the local members traking the current location ,verified those image by the authorities did action on that if it is real and gave the reward to that member
