# GarbageWatcher
This is the tool that will detect garbage and alert the authorities with location and timestamp

## Problem Statement
Garbage containers in cities often overflow because they are not monitored regularly, causing bad smell and health problems for people. There is a need for a system that can automatically alert authorities when a garbage tank is full and help them clean it on time to keep the city clean and healthy.
## What we are proposing
we build a system if Garbage container getting overflow then system detect it and give the alert message to the municipal via the Email or the SMS ,traking the location of that garbage container then municiple flow that and collect the garbage , mark the system as clean the container by the municiple   
## What work has been done by others and fault in it
Identifies the problem of garbage bin overflow caused by the absence of real-time monitoring and delayed municipal collection. The issue is addressed by using an alert-based system that detects overflow and informs authorities with location details for timely cleaning[1].

Highlights inefficiencies in manual garbage monitoring and fixed collection routes, which lead to delayed waste removal. The proposed solution overcomes this by using a mobile-based system that enables location-based reporting and faster administrative action[2].
